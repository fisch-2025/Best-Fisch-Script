## How It Works

The **Roblox Fisch Script** simulates a real-world fishing mechanic. Players can cast their lines into designated water bodies, wait for a fish to bite, and then reel in their catch. The script handles all the logic behind the scenes, ensuring a smooth and fun experience for all.

### Key Components:
- **Fishing Rod**: Equip and use the fishing rod in the game world.
- **Fishing Zones**: Defined areas where players can fish, customizable to fit your game map.
- **Catchable Fish**: Each fish comes with unique attributes like rarity, size, and value.
- **Rewards System**: Players earn coins or in-game items when they catch fish.

## Benefits

- **Boost Engagement**: Keep players hooked (pun intended!) with a fun, repeatable activity.
- **Monetization Opportunities**: Use the fish caught as in-game items for trade or rewards.
- **Customizable for Any Game**: Whether you're building an adventure game or a simulator, this script fits all genres.
